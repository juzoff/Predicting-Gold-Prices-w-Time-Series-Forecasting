# Predicting-Gold-Prices-w-Time-Series-Forecasting
This project predicts future gold prices based on historical data from Quandl, spanning from 1970 to 2020. By applying time series forecasting techniques, such as ARIMA and SARIMA, it aims to forecast gold prices for the years 2020-2022. The project utilizes univariate time series data with date and time features.
